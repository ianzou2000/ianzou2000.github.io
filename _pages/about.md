Hello, this is Jie ZOU speaking. Ian for English world, and noBrandy for the Internet.[^1]

In my life
======
Born in Shenzhen, I have lived here for 23 years. I want to be a normal person with an easy lifestyle and steady footsteps for my goals. 

I like Music, especially the style of R&B, JAZZ, Rap and the Pop in HongKong and Taiwan. I also enjoy film and Japanese anime which I consider one of the best inventions in the human history. To stay happy and healthy, I choose to work out, play badminton, squash, swimming as well as jogging. Love is the most important internal motivation for me.

Outside the life
======
With a strong interest in the area of Financial Mathematics, I wish I could be a quantitative researcher in the future. Quant World is a game created by god where I play the role of a person who kept looking for different keys to open the door in an attempt to discover the treasure behind, so it's an exciting journey.

About this page
======
Encouraged by my mentor of the second intern in ZMate, which is a quantitative investment company in Shenzhen, I decide to build my own personal page to record my progress and share my experiences.
